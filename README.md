Animated Shadow puppet 

Mechanical linkage system run by a stepper motor linked to a bare conductive touch board for proximity sensing. 
Linkage system is the legs of a tiger shadow puppet
Proximity sensor controls the speed of the motor, increased proximity = increased speed 
A baseline speed has been set so the tiger is never fully still when the device is on
